# STAR Presentation Guidelines

This blog documents guidances, including requirements and suggestions, for STAR presentations.

## Guidance on Using Italic vs. Roman Fonts for Symbols

[Guidance](https://iupac.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICTNS-On-the-use-of-italic-and-roman-fonts-for-symbols-in-scientific-text.pdf) on using italic vs. roman fonts for symbols.

- **Note:** It should be written as $p$+$p$ and $p$+Au, etc., which is different from the guidance.

## Title Page

The presenter is **_required_** to add the following:

- Speaker's name, and **"On behalf of the STAR Collaboration"** or **"For the STAR Collaboration"**.
- Speaker's institution name and/or logo.
- **DOE logo:** Please add "Supported in part by" above the DOE logo. Logos from other funding agencies are encouraged as well.
  - It is preferred to use the DOE logo with the text **"Office of Science"**.
- **STAR logo** (some DOE & STAR examples can be found [here](https://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/blog-entry/jeromel/2009/mar/11/quick-upload-logos-qm-2009).
- **Conference name/logo, date, and location**.

_These also apply to posters_

## Footer

It is **_suggested_** to add:

- Speaker name
- Conference name and date
- Slide number
- STAR logo  

**Institution name or logo _should not_ be added.**

## Tips for Slides

Here are some tips for preparing your slides:

- Maintain **consistent capitalization** of your slide titles.
- You can use any font, but try to stick to **at most two fonts**. Font size should not be **less than 20pt**.
- **All plots need axis labels with units** and **STAR or STAR Preliminary** on them.  
  - Include a label with the collision system and energy.
  - Avoid excessive empty space in figures and around edges.
  - Reduce the ranges of axes as much as reasonably possible.
- **Avoid yellow or light green** – they may look good on screen but do not project well.
- Use **both color, symbol shape, and filled/hollow symbols** on graphs to accommodate color-blind individuals.
- If you have **more than three plots on a slide, it's too many**.
- Each slide should have **one key takeaway message** that is clearly highlighted.
- **Make figures as large as possible** – auditoriums are often large.
- Use **bullets, not full sentences** – the audience should focus on your narration, not reading the slides.
- **Limit slides to one per minute** – give the audience time to digest the content.
- Check that **figure axis labels don’t extend off the canvas** and that text does not overlap with axis tick marks.
- Use **high-quality figures**, not low-resolution bitmaps.

## Tips for Posters

Here are some tips for preparing your poster:

- If you include your abstract, it's **okay to modify it slightly** to reflect what you are actually showing.
  - **Major changes should be approved** by your PWG convener.
  - Minor tweaks to the **poster title** are also acceptable.
- **Consistent capitalization** of your poster title and section headings is important.
- Avoid **overcrowding** your poster with text and figures.  
  - People prefer to browse quickly and will not read a lengthy research paper.
  - Aim for **one or two key messages**.
- Use **at most two fonts**, and make them **large** enough to be readable from a distance.
- **All plots need axis labels with units** and **STAR or STAR Preliminary** on them.  
  - Include a label with the collision system and energy.
  - Avoid excessive empty space in figures and around edges.
  - Reduce the ranges of axes as much as reasonably possible.
- **Avoid yellow or light green** – they do not print well.
- Use **both color, symbol shape, and filled/hollow symbols** to ensure clarity for all audiences.
- Each section should have **one key takeaway message** that is clearly highlighted.
- **Make figures as large as possible** – visuals convey more than text.
- Use **bullets instead of full sentences** to encourage discussion.
- Check that **figure axis labels don’t extend off the canvas** and text doesn’t overlap with axis tick marks.
- Use **high-quality figures**, not low-resolution bitmaps, as posters are printed in large format.
